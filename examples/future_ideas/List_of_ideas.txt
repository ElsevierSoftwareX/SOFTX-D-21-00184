Common pitfalls:

- Size mismatches. It would be nice to create the geometry and have a file that can't be edited by the user.

- unit tests of the xml. Make sure that everything looks right and that the BCs are set appropiately. 

Room for improvement:

- remove matlab dependency (should be able to code everything easily in python)
-> with this in mind we can add multithreading support for big geometries

- check if it is really more efficient to have the solid nodes (2s) instead of only bounce backs (1s)

-> if this is the case, we can add support for big volumes by subsampling the domain in parallel with a certain degree of overlap and then stiching it back.

- palabos will support GPUs soon with a minimum ammount of syntax changes. Might be worth it to look into that.

- try the constant density boundary condition. This might help speeding up the un-steady state simulation.

- more viz tools. Vedo, perhaps?

- Improve the contanct angle calculation. Masa has good ideas.
