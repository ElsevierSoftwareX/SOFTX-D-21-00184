# Two-Phase Simulation Python Workflow
All you have to do is the following:
  1) Run ```pwd``` in the terminal once in your simulation directory. Copy and paste the output into ```input.yml``` under the ```simulation directory``` key. 
  2) Run ```run_two_phase_sim.sh``` to start a two-phase Shan-Chen LBM simulation.

More details are to come on all the inputs. For now, there are some comments in ```input.yml``` explaining some of the new things.
