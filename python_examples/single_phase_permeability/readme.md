# Sinlge-Phase Simulation Python Workflow

### Option 1: Using python
Run the following line in your terminal:\
```python 1_phase_sim.py```

A couple notes:
  1) Depending on your system configuration, you may need to use ```python3``` instead of just ```python```
  2) We test on as many systems as we can, but sometimes Python and bash do not always play well together. If you can't run this using Python, please try option 2.

### Option 2: From the terminal
  1) Run ```pwd``` in the terminal once in your simulation directory. Copy and paste the output into ```input.yml``` under the ```simulation directory``` key. 
  2) Run ```run_single_phase_sim.sh``` to start a single-phase LBM simulation.
